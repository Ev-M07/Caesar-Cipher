    <p><strong>the Caesar Cipher Works</strong> 
        The Caesar cipher is a simple way to hide a message by shifting each letter a certain number of places in the alphabet.<br> 
        Imagine the alphabet is a circle, and you move each letter forward by a set number. For example, if you shift by 3:<br>
        
        A becomes D<br>
        
        B becomes E<br>
        
        C becomes F<br>
        
        and so on, until Z, which wraps around to C.<br>

        So, the word "HELLO" with a shift of 3 becomes "KHOOR". To read the secret message, you just shift the letters back by the same number.<br>
        The Caesar cipher was used by Julius Caesar to keep his military messages secret.<br> 
        It is easy to use but not very secure today because there are only 25 possible shifts, so someone can try them all quickly to decode the message.</p>
